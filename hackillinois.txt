*The problem that we were trying to solve is 
understanding the Puppeteer output whether if it is broken 
or just operates as a different API.

*The reason why it is important to solve these issues is because headless 
debugging is very difficult to hash out and we need to mimic real users. Therefore 
it is very important to spend a significant amount of time figuring it out. 

*We created a library in order to map Puppeteer to Instanbul, 
updated the Puppeteer documentation in order to reflect our
better approach to coverage, and last but not least, created 
a splash page for our project.


Puppeteer

Recently announced by Google to assist with Chrome browser automation, Puppeteer
is a Node library which provides a high-level API in order to carry out its 
task to control Chrome (and eventually the world, I'm kidding!)

Instabul

Instabul basically instruments JavaScript code with line counters
in order to track how well the unit tests exercise the codebase. 
The well-known cmd client is nyc.

Chromium

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a 
safer and efficient way for all users to experience 
the web.
